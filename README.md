# **Welcome to the Docker Introduction Course!** ðŸš¢

In this course, we will cover the basics of Docker, focusing on **containerizing applications** and managing Docker containers.  
By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of Docker's core concepts, and you'll gain **hands-on experience** by containerizing both a **Node.js** and a **Next.js** application.

## **What You'll Learn** ðŸ“˜

- How to create and manage **Docker containers**.
- How to write a **Dockerfile** for **Node.js** and **Next.js** apps.

## **Contents of This Repository** ðŸ“‚

In this folder, you will find **two applications**:

1. **`/node_app_to_dockerize/`**:  
   This is the **Node.js application** that we will containerize during the lesson.
   
2. **`/next_app/`**:  
   The second folder contains the code for a simple **Next.js app**, which you will Dockerize as part of the exercise.
